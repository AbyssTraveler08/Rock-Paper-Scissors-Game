Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮
A simple console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in C++ with a best-of-three system. This project demonstrates structured programming, randomness in C++11, and interactive gameplay.

📌 Features
✅ Player vs. Computer gameplay
✅ Best-of-three winner determination
✅ Randomized computer moves using C++11 <random>
✅ Modular functions for clean and structured code
✅ User-friendly input validation

🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ The player enters their choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors
2️⃣ The computer randomly selects its move
3️⃣ The winner is determined based on standard game rules
4️⃣ The process repeats 3 times
5️⃣ The best-of-three winner is announced

📜 Installation & Compilation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AbyssTraveler08/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.git

Compile the code using a C++11-compatible compiler:
g++ -std=c++11 rock_paper_scissors.cpp -o game

Run the game:
./game

📄 Code Structure
main.cpp → Contains the main game loop

🎯 Game Rules
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
If both selections are the same, it's a tie
